/**
 * The Intel 8259 Programmable Interrupt Controller handles up to eight vectored
 * priority interrupts for the CPU. It is cascadable for up to 64 vectored
 * priority interrupts without additional circuitry. It is packaged in a 28-pin
 * DIP, used NMOS technology and requires a single +5V supply. Circuitry is
 * static, requiring no clock input.
 *
 * The 8259 is designed to minimize software and real time overhead in handling
 * multi-level priority interrupts. It has several modes, permitting
 * optimization for a variety of system requirements.
